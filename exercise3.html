<h1> The heading </h1>
<p> The oldest classical Greek and Latin writing had little or no space 
    between words and could be written in boustrophedon (alternating directions). 
    Over time, text direction (left to right) became standardized, 
    and word dividers and terminal punctuation became common.</p>

        In ancient manuscripts, another means to divide sentences into paragraphs 
        was a line break (newline) followed by an initial at the beginning of the next paragraph.
        An initial is an oversized capital letter, sometimes outdented beyond the margin of the text. 
        This style can be seen, for example, in the original Old English manuscript of Beowulf. 
        Outdenting is still used in English typography, though not commonly.
