        <h1>Randomness</h1>
        <p>In the common parlance, randomness is the apparent lack of pattern or predictability in events.
           A random sequence of events, symbols or steps often has no order and does not follow an intelligible pattern or combination. 
           Individual random events are by definition unpredictable, but since they often follow a probability distribution, 
           the frequency of different outcomes over numerous events (or "trials") is predictable.</p>

        <p>For example, when throwing two dice, the outcome of any particular roll is unpredictable, but a sum of 7 will occur 
           twice as often as 4. In this view, randomness is a measure of uncertainty of an outcome, rather than its haphazardness, 
           and applies to concepts of chance, probability, and information entropy.</p>

           According to Ramsey theory, ideal randomness is impossible especially for large structures. For example, professor 
           Theodore Motzkin pointed out that "while disorder is more probable in general, complete disorder is impossible".
           Misunderstanding of this can lead to numerous conspiracy theories.</p></div><br><br>
